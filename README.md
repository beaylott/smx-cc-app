emoncms connector for Nobel Grid Smart Meter Extension.
Based on the hypriot alpine base image.

## What is SMX, Nobel Grid, emoncms, and smx-emonhub?

The Smart Meter Extension (SMX) is a concept hardware device developed
as part of the [Nobel Grid](http://nobelgrid.eu/) project, a Horizon 2020 
programme for developing new and innovative solutions for community smart grids.

[emoncms](https://emoncms.org) is an open source energy monitoring platform.

smx-emonhub is a Docker-based application which runs on the SMX
and forwards metering data to emoncms using the [emonhub](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonhub) 
Python application.
